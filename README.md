# Dynamic-optical-coherence-tomography simulatior library by computational optics group (COG DOCT-simulator library) 


The COG DOCT-simulator library is a Python library which provides the classes and functions to simulate a time-sequence of OCT speckle with the modeling of the scatterer motions.

About authors
--------------
This library is released by [Computational Optics Group at the University of Tsukuba](https://cog-news.blogspot.com/), and was developed as a part of our research projects of computationally augmented optical coherence microscope and optical coherence tomography.

Available scatterer motion models
---------------------------
Random ballistic model  
Diffsusion model  
Mono-direction traslation model

Manuals
------------------------
- Example code to generate the 32-time time-sequence of OCT speckle considering the scatterer motion model as the random ballistic model using this library can be found [here](example.py).
- Module design can be found [here](documents\Module_design.docx).
